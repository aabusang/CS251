#Project 4 ReadMe File

##Elementary CA
1. Has a cell class change characters to cells, black or white cell.
2. Has a runner class that controls the intervals for next generations to appear on th window.
3. Has a Grid1d class that implements that logic and generational evolving of the automata.
4. Has a Elementary CA class that contains the main and start function for the program to run.

##Game of Life
1. Has a cell class just similar to elementary CA
2. Has a GameOfLife class which contains main and start methods, reads input too
3. Has a Grid2d class where I implement all the logic for the game
##Langton's Loop
I didn't even understand this well, so makes not much sense to code
1. Has a cell class that change characters to cells and can return a cell's color given its value
2. Had a Langton's Loop Class that contains the main and start functions where the program runs.
3. Has a GridLL Class that has methods that perform the logic for the automata
4. Has a similar runner class just like the previous once
###Not Finished
1. I run out of time and have not been able to completely implement the logic of updating and showing the CA
